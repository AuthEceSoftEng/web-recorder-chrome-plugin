# Web Recorder Chrome Extension
Web Recorder is an automated website testing and monitoring service that checks for problems with your website or application. It carries out operations in a browser, the same way a user would, to ensure that everything is working properly.

Your browser tests are going to mimic a user's journey through your website or application, so why not create them via your own journey? Web Recorder provides a free Chrome recorder extension that allows you to record operations and assertions right in your web browser. Once you're done recording a test, it's saved to our cloud service. At that point, you can view, edit and automate the test within your account.
